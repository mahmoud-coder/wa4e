Hello and welcome to my site where you can learn to build database-backed
web sites using PHP, MySQL, JQuery, and Handlebars. 
You can use this web site many different ways:
<ul>
<li>
You browse my videos and course materials under <a href="lessons">Lessons</a>.  The materials
I have developed
for this class are all provided with a Creative Commons license so you can download or link to 
them to incorporate them into your own teaching if you like.</li>
<li>
If you <a href="tsugi/login.php">log in</a> to this site 
it is as if you have joined a free, global
open and online course.  You have a grade book, autograded assignments, a discussion forum, and can earn
badges for your efforts.</li>
<li>
We take your privacy seriously on this site, you can review our
<a href="privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for more details.
</li>
<li>
If you want to use these Creative Commons Licensed materials 
in your own classes you can download or link to the artifacts on this site,
<a href="tsugi/cc/export.php">export the course material</a> as an
IMS Common Cartridge®, or apply for
an IMS Learning Tools Interoperability® (LTI®)
<a href="tsugi/admin/key/index.php">key and secret</a> 
 to launch the autograders from your LMS.
</li>
<li>
The <a href="code" target="_blank">sample code</a> for this site including the autograders, slides, and course content is all available on
<a href="https://github.com/csev/wa4e" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.  That means you could make your own
copy of the course site, publish it and remix it any way you like.  Even more exciting, you could translate
the entire site (course) into your own language and publish it.</li>
</ul>
<?php } ?>
This site uses <a href="http://www.tsugi.org" target="_blank">Tsugi</a> 
framework to embed a learning 
management system into this site and handle the autograders.

to build these kinds of sites for yourself, please see the
